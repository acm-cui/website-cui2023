# Paper submission information

We invite the submission of research papers, describing original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including [the other tracks of CUI {{ site.conference.year }}]({{ "/submit/" | relative_url }} "All submission tracks at CUI {{ site.conference.year }}")).

We particularly encourage the submission of high-quality replication studies in addition to well-designed studies with null results. 

Papers are original contributions from a broad range of disciplines including human-computer interaction, computer science, engineering, speech technology, linguistics, psychology, cognitive sciences, sociology and other cognate disciplines.

## The process

All submissions will proceed through the following process. Please contact the <a href="{{ site.data.oc['tracks']['roles'][page.track.chairs]['email'] }}" title="Contact the CUI {{ site.conference.year }} {{ site.data.oc['tracks']['roles'][page.track.chairs]['label'] }} if you have any questions">{{ site.data.oc['tracks']['roles'][page.track.chairs]['label'] }}</a> if you have any questions.

### 1. Prepare your paper

Submissions of research papers must be in English, in PDF format, anonymised using the [CHI anonymization policy](https://chi2022.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/chi-anonymization-policy/ "CHI 2022 Anonymization Policy"), and approximately **6,000-8,000 words** (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, and any other content excluding references and acknowledgments). Submissions above 8,000 words or below 5,000 words, will be considered for desk rejection. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.

You must use the [ACM LaTeX or Word templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template "ACM templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX") to prepare your submission.  LaTeX users may start their work by using the official ACM template available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc "ACM Primary Article Template templates on Overleaf"), which we strongly encourage. LaTeX users should have the following document class: <code>\documentclass[sigconf, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}</code> for submission.

Word users should use [the double-column "Interim Template"](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template#h-interim-template "ACM Interim Template for submissions") during submission and review and should be prepared to submit to TAPS _approximately one week earlier_ than the stated camera-ready deadline. Word users may be required to reimplement their paper, if accepted, into the correct document format for the publishing process.

ACM's CCS concepts and keywords are not required for submission and peer review but are required if your paper is accepted and published by the ACM.

### 2. Submit your paper

You should submit your paper to the [conference submission system]({{ "/submit/pcs/" | relative_url }} "CUI {{ site.conference.year }} submission system"). You must include your title, abstract, author details, and paper as a PDF. Your paper must be anonymised, or it may be desk rejected.

We ask you to submit your metadata and abstract a week before submission of your paper PDF to allow for preliminary work on the peer review process to begin.

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies "ACM Publications Policies and Procedures"), including [ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects "https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects"). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

We ask you to make sure that your submission is accessible for all users. To accomplish this, please follow the [SIGCHI Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/ "SIGCHI's guide to an Accessible Submission").

### 3. Await reviews

All papers will be reviewed by three reviewers: one who is a member of the programme committee (referred to as the ‘second associate chair’ or '2AC') and two non-programme committee members. Another member of the programme committee will lead the reviewing process and write a meta review (referred to as the ‘first associate chair’ or '1AC'). Papers for which there is a very high agreement among reviewers regarding recommendation for inclusion in the proceedings will receive early acceptance decisions. All accept decisions are conditional and will be checked by the 1AC before final acceptance.

A small number of papers that may require further revisions will be shepherded (equivalent to major revisions or light revise & resubmit), with 3 weeks allocated for authors to coordinate the revisions with the AC coordinating each paper. This may include targeted revisions to specific parts of the original submission addressing the most significant points raised by the reviewers, or alternative forms as deemed appropriate by the AC.


### 4. Prepare your paper for publication

If your paper is accepted, you should de-anonymise it. You must include [CCS concepts](https://dl.acm.org/ccs "ACM Computing Classification System") and keywords for publication.

Programme Chairs will send information on how to ready your paper for the publishing process. Word users may be required to reimplement their paper, if accepted, into the correct document format for the publishing process, while LaTeX users will have to adjust their <code>documentclass</code>.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference, otherwise we cannot guarantee publication of your paper. Accepted papers will be archived in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/" title="The ACM Digital Library">ACM Digital Library</a>.

You will receive an email from ACM to assign the rights for your paper, following which you will receive an email from "The ACM Publishing System" (TAPS), which will handle the generation of the final version of your paper. Accepted papers will be produced from LaTeX or Word source files into a single column HTML document and a two-column PDF for publication. We recommend all authors read ACM's guidance for [TAPS Best Practice](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/taps-best-practices "The ACM Publishing System (TAPS) Best Practices").

Please ensure that you and your co-authors [obtain an ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/register "Register for an ORCID ID"), so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently [made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs "ACM committment to collect ORCID IDs from all authors"). The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

All ACM publications follow the [Green Open Access route by default](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#green "Details on ACM's Green Open Access policies"), although authors have the opportunity to independently pay a fee for [Gold Open Access](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#oapricing "Details on Gold Open Access pricing for ACM publications"). The total fee payable depends on the author(s) ACM membership status.

### 5. Present your paper

Authors will be given an oral presentation slot at the conference. The specific details of this presentation will be provided closer to the conference.

Your paper will be published in the CUI Proceedings in the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/ "ACM Digital Library"). [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org " ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction") participates in the [ACM Open Table of Contents (OpenTOC)](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess "ACM Open Access information") service, which means papers will be freely available from this website for the first year after publication.
