[SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org " ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction") participates in the [ACM Open Table of Contents (OpenTOC)](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess "ACM Open Access information") service, which means all papers and extended abstracts will be freely available from this website for the first year after publication. HTML versions will be available from the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org "The ACM Digital Library") for those with access.

Each track of CUI {{ site.conference.year }} will include synchronous and asynchronous hybrid experiences during the conference. Hybrid experiences include:

## Papers
Paper presentations will be livestreamed over [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom.us official website"). Synchronous question and answer session with each author will take place after each presentations, with session chairs and student volunteers ensuring that  in-person participants queue for a single microphone so that remote participants can hear questions, and remote participants will be able to virtually cue to ask their questions as well. Asynchronous discussion for each paper will continue in the CUI Discord server, with channels dedicated to each paper session.

## Posters
During in-person poster and demos sessions, there will be simultaneous [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom.us official website") poster sessions in which groups of poster authors will be available on Zoom to answer questions from online participants. Asynchronous poster discussion will continue in the CUI Discord server, with channels dedicated to posters.


## Demos
Demos for which there is online material (e.g. a website, a video) will be made available on the CUI {{ site.conference.year }} website. During in-person posters and demos sessions, there will be simultaneous [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom.us official website") demos sessions in which CUI organisers will interact with in-person demos while on Zoom to give online participants an impression of the experience. Asynchronous demo discussion will continue in the CUI Discord server, with channels dedicated to demos.

## Workshops
Workshop organisers can choose to make their workshops either fully in-person or hybrid. Hybrid workshops will give remote participants [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom.us official website") access to the synchronous aspects of the workshop. Specific workshop participation methods will be determined by the organisers of each workshop.


## Doctoral Consortium
The CUI Doctoral Consortium will be accessible to virtual participants via [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom.us official website"). Organisers will ensure that online DC participants have a chance to discuss their research with the DC mentors, some of whom will be in person and others who will be remote. Asynchronous DC discussion will continue in a dedicated channel in the CUI Discord server.


## Coffee and breaks
Coffee breaks and hallway chats will be facilitated over [Zoom](https://zoom.us "Zoom.us official website"), with student volunteers roaming informal sessions to connect on-site and online participants, making chance encounters and catch-up chitchat possible no matter where you're attending from.
