# Travel support

SIGCHI offers two programs that can benefit CUI attendees: the [Gary Marsden Travel Award (GMTA)](https://sigchi.org/awards/gary-marsden-travel-awards/ "Information about the Gary Marsden Travel Award") and the [SIGCHI Development Fund (SDF)](https://sigchi.org/resources/sigchi-development-fund/ "Information about the SIGCHI Development Fund").

The Gary Marsden Travel Award program support SIGCHI members (students or professionals) attending SIGCHI conferences. It provides complimentary registration and travel grants for those who need financial help or lack institutional support.

Workshop organizers can consider applying to the SIGCHI Development Fund if they need financial support for their event. The SDF is also open to you as conference organizers.


## Gary Marsden Travel Awards (GMTA)
In recognition of Gary Marsden’s contributions and inspiration, SIGCHI established the [Gary Marsden Travel Award (GMTA)](https://sigchi.org/awards/gary-marsden-travel-awards/ "Information about the Gary Marsden Travel Award") to support its members in attending ACM SIGCHI conferences. Eligible members can be undergraduate and graduate students, early-career researchers (such as those who are ≤ 5 years post-graduation), and those suffering from financial hardship or lacking institutional support. 

Please see our [call for applications](https://sigchi.submittable.com/submit "Apply for the GMTA on the SIGCHI Submittable") on Submittable for specific criteria, details of the award, review timelines, and for applying.

Deadlines are on the 9th of January, February, March, May, July, September, and November at 11:59 PM AoE. If we offer extensions, the new deadline will be noted on the application website. 

You must apply by a deadline more than one month before the start of the conference that you plan to attend (we recommend applying as soon as you have your conference acceptance). For transparency, award recipients will be announced periodically on the [SIGCHI website](https://sigchi.org/gary-marsden-travel-award-recipients/ "The ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction"). 

Please email [sigchi-4all@acm.org](mailto:sigchi-4all@acm.org "Email SIGCHI 4 all") with any questions about the GMTA or fixes/feedback for the application form.


## SIGCHI Development Fund (SDF)
The SIGCHI Development Fund (SDF) provides resources for the SIGCHI community to spur communication, innovation, and expansion of HCI at the global and local levels. We invite projects aiming to experiment with new opportunities, reach out to new groups, promote sustainability, inclusivity, and accessibility, and support mentoring opportunities. All SIGCHI members are eligible to apply. 

Please see our [call for applications](https://sigchi.submittable.com/submit "Apply for the SDF on the SIGCHI Submittable") on Submittable for submission instructions, evaluation criteria, and funding caps.

The SDF has an ongoing open call, and you can expect results around one month after the submission.
