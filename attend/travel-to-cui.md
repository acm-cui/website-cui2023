## Travelling to Eindhoven

Eindhoven is a relatively large city in the Netherlands, and is connected by plane, train and road.

### Travelling by plane
Typically, most flights to the Netherlands fly into Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam. From Schipol Airport, Eindhoven can be reached by train (see below).

Alternatively, Eindhoven has a small international airport, with connections to major cities throughout Europe. The airport is about a 10 minute taxi ride, or bus ride from the city centre. You can check flights and connections at on [the Eindhoven Airport website](https://www.eindhovenairport.nl/en "Eindhoven Airport website").

### Travelling by train
Eindhoven is part of the intercity network of the Dutch railways and has direct rail connections with Amsterdam, Den Haag, Rotterdam, Heerlen and Maastricht.

To get to Eindhoven from Schiphol Airport, you can take a direct train from Schipol Airport to Eindhoven Central station, the _NS Intercity_ towards _Venlo_. The journey from Schiphol to Eindhoven takes 1.5 hours. You can plan your train trip through the Netherlands using an on-line route planner provided by [the Dutch railways on their English webpage](https://www.ns.nl/en "Dutch railways route planner").

### Travelling by car
Eindhoven is situated at the junction of A2 and A67 motorways, as you can see on theÂ schematic map of the city.

## Directions to the TU/e

The Eindhoven University of Technology campus is situated in the centre of Eindhoven. You can find [the campus map](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/tue-campus "TU/e campus map"), with information about accessibility, and conference venue buildings (Atlas (3) and the Zwarte Doos (4)).

The compact green campus, not only has university buildings, but sports facilities too, as well as a student centre. Most buildings are connected via walkways. Because of this, the TU/e is one of the most easily accessible universities for people with mobility issues. 

### Travelling to TU/e by public transportation

If travelling on foot, the university campus is only a few minutes walk from Eindhoven Central Station. The conference venue is De Zwarte Doos ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/fZ72SohQy3SqQbsd6 "De Zwarte Doos on Google Maps") / [Apple Maps](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Den%20Dolech%202,%205612%20AZ%20Eindhoven,%20Netherlands&auid=16908367583592185841&ll=51.446342,5.484281&lsp=9902&q=De%20Zwarte%20Doos "De Zwarte Doos on Apple Maps")).

Given the short distance between Eindhoven Central Station and the campus, there is no bus stop that substantially shortens the walk.

Alternatively, taxis are available in Eindhoven from the south exit of the Station ("centre side").

### Travelling to TU/e by car
From all motorways to and around Eindhoven (A2, A58, A67 en A270) follow the road signs with 'Centrum' until 'Universiteit' is indicated. There is sufficient parking space on campus.
