# Accessibility and Diversity

CUI {{ site.conference.year }} strives to be an inclusive and accessible conference, and we will do our best to accommodate requests for special assistance. Information will be posted here as we develop our plans for the conference, to help you decide whether the conference will be accessible to you. Please get in touch with us if your question is not answered here, or if the conference arrangements as described are not enough to allow you to attend. 

The {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['label'] }} is progressively assembling this information. If you have questions or wish to raise a point regarding our efforts to ensure all attendees can participate, please contact us <a href="{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['email'] }}">by email</a>. Rest assured,  we will work with you to make the conference accessible..

## Pronouns

Per CUI’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity, we wish all attendees to indicate their pronouns to promote a safe, welcoming environment. This information will be included on your CUI {{ site.conference.year }} badge and in the online attendee profile of the virtual platform to foster dignity, courtesy, understanding, and mutual respect during interactions throughout the conference. Providing/displaying your pronoun on your badge is not mandatory.

## How do I communicate accessibility needs to organizers?

The {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['label'] }} aims to ensure the conference is accessible to everyone. When you register for the conference, there will be questions for you to answer about your needs. Please complete these to indicate anything that will help make the conference accessible.

Possible requests include but are not limited to: sign language interpretation, note taker, assistive listening device, captioning, description (for slides, overheads or videos), and so on. The {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['label'] }}r will follow up with requests. You can contact them directly at any time by <a href="{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['email'] }}">emailing us</a>.

Please be aware that some accommodations may be difficult to provide at short notice, and we may only be able to accommodate some requests.
Will sign language interpretation be available?

If you request sign language interpretation in your conference registration, we will strive to provide interpretation for all conference presentations and events, including informal conversations. Please register your request before the 25th June 2023 by <a href="{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['email'] }}">emailing us</a>. You may also bring your interpreter to the event. Please reach out to the {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['label'] }} to set this up.


<!-- ## Will childcare service be provided during the main conference day? -->

<!-- We are happy to announce that we will help parents to arrange and cover the costs of high-quality childcare for children during the main conference days (Monday – Wednesday) starting at 09:00 and running throughout the day (with a break during lunch).  -->

<!-- If your child(ren) will accompany you to the conference center, and if you need childcare for your children, please contact the {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['accessibility_diversity']['label'] }}s at cui2023-diversity@cui.acm.org and the local chairs at cui2023-local@cui.acm.org as early as possible to arrange childcare service for your kids. -->

<!-- ## Nursing room -->

<!-- The lactation room is located on the conference venue. It is a comfortable, quiet individual space for parents and caregivers to feed your baby.

If you need to use this room, please reach out to the local chair at cui2023-local@cui.acm.org to book this room at a specific time and datetime during the conference. -->
