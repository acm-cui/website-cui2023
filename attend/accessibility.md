# Accessibility and Diversity

CUI {{ site.conference.year }} strives to be an inclusive and accessible conference, and we will do our best to accommodate requests for special assistance. Information will be posted here as we develop our plans for the conference, to help you decide whether the conference will be accessible to you. Please get in touch with us if your question is not answered here, or if the conference arrangements as described are not enough to allow you to attend. 

The {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['diversity']['label'] }} is progressively assembling this information. If you have questions or wish to raise a point regarding our efforts to ensure all attendees can participate, please contact us <a href="{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['diversity']['email'] }}">by email</a>. Rest assured,  we will work with you to make the conference accessible..


##  What if I have a medical emergency or health problem during the conference?



**In case of emergency call 112 for emergency services.**

The nearest hospital is the Catharina Hospital, located at 3.5 km from the conference venue. If you require non-urgent medical care, please contact {{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['diversity']['label'] }} by <a href="{{ site.data.oc['conference']['roles']['diversity']['email'] }}">emailing us</a>, or ask any student volunteer. They will provide you with information about local doctors, specialists, chiropractors, etc.

For non-resident attendees, buying travel insurance that covers medical expenses is strongly recommended as fees for emergency treatment can be very high.


## Pronouns

Per CUIâ€™s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity, we wish all attendees to indicate their pronouns to promote a safe, welcoming environment. This information will be included on your CUI {{ site.conference.year }} badge and in the online attendee profile of the virtual platform to foster dignity, courtesy, understanding, and mutual respect during interactions throughout the conference. Providing/displaying your pronoun on your badge is not mandatory.
