CUI {{ site.conference.year }} is intended to be an in-person conference and as such our registration fees reflect running an in-person event. That being said, we recognise that it may be possible for everyone who wishes to attend to do so in-person, thus also offer an virtual/online attendance-only option. 

{% if page.registration_open %}
Registration for CUI {{ site.conference.year }} is now open.
{% else %}
We hope to open registration for CUI {{ site.conference.year }} very soon.
<!-- Registration online has now closed, and you must register on-site.-->
{% endif %}

Authors with papers accepted must register by **30th June 2023**. At least one author of each accepted paper must be registered to attend the conference in person. A paper without a corresponding registration may be withheld from publication. We will support remote presentations if attendance is not possible. There will be no on site registration.

Please ensure you register at the correct rate—if you do not, you will be liable to pay the difference. You can revise your registration online up to one week before the conference.

### Registration fees

There are four different rates for registration at CUI {{ site.conference.year }} in-person and two different registration deadlines:

* Early registration closes on **15th June 2023**
* Late registration closes on **19th July 2023**
