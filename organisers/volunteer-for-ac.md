# Apply to be an Associate Chair

CUI {{ site.conference.year }} is looking for Associate Chairs (AC) for the CUI {{ site.conference.year }} Programme Committee! The deadline for applications is the **15th December 2022**.

For 2023 we are adopting the CHI AC+reviewer model for CUI for the first time.

## About the role

CUI Program Committee (PC) members will be assigned around 6 submissions as part of the peer review process over several months early in {{ site.conference.year }}. Each PC member will be the primary associate chair (1AC) for about half the submissions assigned to that PC member, and secondary (2AC) for the other half. The process for PC members will begin around 15 February (submission deadline), and finish on 27 April.


## Papers reviewing process

Note that CUI submissions are typically around 8,000 words in length excluding references, with longer papers being considered for desk rejection unless the length is commensurate to the contribution or the methodological approach. More details about the CUI conference can be found on the [papers track page]({{ "/submit/papers/" | relative_url }} "Papers track at CUI {{ site.conference.year }}"). For additional details you are also welcome to contact us, the CUI papers chairs (Joel E Fischer, Donald McMillan, and Jaisie Sin) at cui2023-papers@conversationaluserinterfaces.org
