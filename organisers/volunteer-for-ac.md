# Apply to be an Associate Chair

CUI {{ site.conference.year }} is looking for Associate Chairs (AC) for the CUI {{ site.conference.year }} Programme Committee! The deadline for applications is the **8th December 2022**.

## About the role

CUI Program Committee (PC) members will be assigned around 6 submissions as part of the peer review process over several months early in {{ site.conference.year }}. Each PC member will be the primary associate chair (1AC) for about half the submissions assigned to that PC member, and secondary (2AC) for the other half. The process for PC members will begin around 15 February (submission deadline), and finish on 27 April. At CUI, we use a "shepherded" process for papers that require revisions, which are overseen by the 1AC responsible for each paper that is neither rejected nor accepted directly - we expect roughly half of submissions to require shepherding (which is a lighter form of "revise and resubmit").

## Papers reviewing process

For each submission overseen as 1AC, PC members recruit 2 external reviewers who each provide a review, and then write a meta-review summarizing your recommendation for acceptance or rejection. The 1AC does not write a review (only a meta-review). A review will be required for each submission overseen as 2AC.

Note that CUI submissions are typically around 8,000 words in length excluding references, with longer papers being considered for desk rejection unless the length is commensurate to the contribution or the methodological approach.

For more details, please see the [papers track page]({{ "/submit/papers/" | relative_url }} "Papers track at CUI {{ site.conference.year }}").
