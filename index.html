            <strong>ACM CUI {{ site.conference.year }}</strong> will be in <strong>{{ site.conference.location }}</strong>, from <strong>{{ site.conference.dates }}</strong>. CUI has now been welcomed into the <a href="https://acm.org" title="Website for the Association for Computing Machinery">ACM</a> family, and is now a <a href="https://sigchi.org" title="Website for the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction">SIGCHI</a> sponsored conference!
        </p>

        <p>
            There has been an increasing interest in language-based interactions with technology. Driven by the commercial success of intelligent personal assistant devices such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, the number of natural language and conversation-based interactions is growing in commercial settings.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            CUI {{ site.conference.year }} aims to further develop a collaborative community around human-computer interaction issues in speech and language technology, with a specific interest in theory-based and applied scientific issues in the field of speech and text-based conversational user interfaces. Thus CUI 2023 further looks to bring together relevant communities (e.g., ISCA, ACM SIGCHI, CogSci, CHIIR), to publish, disseminate and showcase high-quality cutting-edge research related to the field, promote insight and debate in this exciting and essential discipline within language interfaces.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The CUI community has been growing at a rapid pace these past few years and we are continuing to develop the conference series.  We are planning for the conference to be an in-person event.
